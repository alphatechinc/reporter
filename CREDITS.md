Reporter is inspired by a series of projects authored mostly by [Darren Noll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenbnoll).
At [Square](https://squareup.com) on the Risk team (antifraud), much of the early development in machine learning and operational efficiency was driven by models that the team improved daily.
Automated daily email reports based on SQL queries were the perfect tools to connect model output to queues for model verification and manual review.
These reports gave us confidence in our performance to scale more than 100x in just 3.5 years.
Similar reports became the most popular internal tools in the company, with the favorite use case of monitoring metrics in real time without the myraid problems of metrics dashboards.
Their ease of use made them popular for the CEO and individual data scientists alike.

Reporter aims to provide similar startup-oriented functionality, simplicity, and ease of use.
